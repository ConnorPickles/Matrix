# About
This collection of Matrix objects is something I wrote while taking a Linear Algebra course, to see if I could apply what I was learning. They are meant to be used as data types. 

# Instructions
Clone or download this repository. If downloaded, unzip the folder. MatrixTester.java contains many matrices and methods that can be used to test various functionality of the various objects.
